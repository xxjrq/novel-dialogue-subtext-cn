# Dialogue Subtext Rewrite for Fiction

Turn flat fiction dialogue into distinct character voices without changing supplied facts. Provide a dialogue excerpt, each character's immediate goal, and their relationship; receive a revised dialogue plus line-by-line subtext notes. Missing essentials are reported instead of invented.

## Input and output

Use one chapter, scene, or short passage at a time (up to 100 table rows). Input needs speakers and lines, current goals, relationship, and non-negotiable facts or tone. Output includes revised dialogue, a surface-meaning/subtext/fact-preservation table, and a voice-difference check. Longer work should be split by scene.

```bash
npx skills add xxjrq/novel-dialogue-subtext-cn
```
